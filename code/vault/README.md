# README Vault Setup

The `policies` folder contains the policies needed to administer the basic vault set up like a vault admin, and an example approle.

This folder contains scripts that allows you to run a development version of HashiCorp Vault locally on your machine using Docker.

The scripts are named in a numeric way which corresponds with the order of execution.

***

Run scripts in order:

1. [`./0_update_requirements.sh`](./0_update_requirements.sh)

2. [`./1_start_server.sh`](./1_start_server.sh)

3. [`./10_init_vault.sh`](./10_init_vault.sh)

4.  `cat /tmp/vault.init` to view root token

4. Create a file: `touch .secret0`, and fill VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID, VAULT_USERNAME and VAULT_PASSWORD with your own values:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  export VAULT_ADDR='https://127.0.0.1:8200'
  export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID='' # to fill in Initial Root Token here
  export VAULT_USERNAME='' # to fill in your own username
  export VAULT_PASSWORD='' # to fill in your own password
  ```
  
  *** This will be your secret0, precious root secret.***
  
5. [`source ./secret0`](.)

3. [`./2_ready_userpass.sh`](./2_ready_userpass.sh)

4. [`./3_ready_approle.sh`](./3_ready_approle.sh)

5. [`./4_test_approle.sh`](./4_test_approle.sh)

6. [`./5_start_ui.sh`](./5_start_ui.sh)

7. Put secrets into the Vault - i.e. mongodb url, etc.

To shutdown all vault services, run:

1. [`./99_shutdown_all.sh`](./99_shutdown_all.sh)


When you fully understand what the scripts are doing, and is lazy, run all scripts at once using:

1. [`./lazy_start_all.sh`](./lazy_start_all.sh)

2. View output here: `tail -f nohup.out`
